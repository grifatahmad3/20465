Open University System Labs Course - 2024B

Finished course final grade 90

Project (homework 14) finished with grade 88, receieved the following feedback (translated to English by Google):

"Ahmed
It is obvious that you worked hard on the project,
However,
You did not build data structures correctly,
It is not right to concentrate several data structures/constants into one H file
The public files should be clear and documented
The right thing is to make one data structure for the H file and divide it into a public part and a private part
You missed edge cases and the program breaks and does not complete what it should do
It is better to reduce inconsistent code such as multiple exits from a subprogram, use of break and continue, etc.
Functions should be short and focused on parts of the logic, your logic is too long.
Constants should be used in some places you did not use
It is better that the main program does not contain logic
Maybe it was right to divide it into additional data structures"
